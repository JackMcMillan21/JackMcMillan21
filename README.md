# Hello, World  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Jack McMillan and I am currently a student at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. You can find me on Linked for all buisness inquires.  

I am a student that strives to learn in all aspects of the technical field and can pick up new things quickly. I have experience in both physical and technical skills when relating to this field and would love to be apart of your team. 

My programming experience includes JavaScript, C#, Java, and small amounts of python. A majority of the time I am working as a front end developer, working with HTML and CSS as well. You can find recently completed projects above!
